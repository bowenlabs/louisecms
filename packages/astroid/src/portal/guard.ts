// Role-gated routing for the portal.
//
// coracle and ghostfire independently built the same thing: a declarative table
// of `prefix → roles`, walked once per request. Declarative rather than a guard
// call inside each page, because a guard you have to remember to write is a
// guard someone eventually forgets — and the page that forgets it is the one
// that leaks.
//
// Three answers, and which one you give matters:
//
//   not signed in, HTML   → redirect to the login page, carrying `next`
//   not signed in, API    → 401 JSON (a redirect to an HTML login page is
//                           useless to fetch(); it looks like success)
//   signed in, wrong role → 403 for API, and for HTML a redirect to the area
//                           this user DOES have — not back to login, which
//                           reads as "your password failed" when it didn't
