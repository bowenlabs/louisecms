// This is the gap these tests exist for: every route below was already mounted
// and already worked, in the sense that it returned 200. Each was also missing
// one option, and in each case the failure was invisible — a dashboard that
// renders empty, a KV namespace nothing writes to, a delete-safety scan with
// nothing to scan. "The route is in the plan" was never the property worth
// asserting.
