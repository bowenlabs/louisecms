// Org-membership editor access (issue #100). The organization plugin
// (getLouiseAuth's `organizations` option) introduces a SECOND access axis
// beside the global admin allowlist: a user may edit an organization's content
// when they hold an editor role (owner/admin by default) in THAT organization.
//
// `resolveEditorSession` gates on the global admin-plugin role (the owner/
// engineer superusers, from the env allowlist — unchanged). `resolveOrgEditor`
// gates on org membership instead, so a per-tenant editor never has to be in the
// deploy-wide allowlist. The two coexist: a newly-invited org member gets the
// global role "user" (they're not in the allowlist), and their edit rights come
// from membership. The site decides which organization a request belongs to —
// the sole org for a single site, or resolved from the hostname for multi-tenant
// hosting — and passes it in, so Louise stays unopinionated about that mapping,
// exactly like `requireRole`.
//
// Membership is read straight from Better Auth's `member` table over D1 (that
// table is owned by Better Auth, like `user` in editor/editors.ts), so this
// needs no version-specific server API and honors the same `tablePrefix`.
