// louise-toolkit/worker — `withHealing`: self-healing recovery for Worker
// routes.
//
// Louise primitives never throw a raw `Error` — every failure is a typed
// `LouiseError` carrying a machine-readable `.code` (DB_ERROR, CACHE_ERROR,
// STORAGE_ERROR, …). That typed surface is exactly what a recovery layer needs:
// `withHealing` wraps a route and, when it throws a `LouiseError`, consults a
// per-code policy to decide what to do instead of surfacing a 500.
//
// Three deterministic strategies, composable per error code:
//
//   - **retry**      — re-run the route (with optional exponential backoff).
//                      For transient infrastructure blips (D1/R2/KV hiccups).
//   - **fallback**   — serve a degraded/stale Response instead of throwing.
//                      Fails *soft*: a stale cache hit beats an error page.
//   - **escalate**   — hand the failure off out-of-band via `ctx.waitUntil`,
//                      so recovery never blocks (or breaks) the response.
//
// The escalation hook is the seam a future *self-updating* loop plugs into:
// today `escalate` might enqueue the failure for a human or a deterministic
// job; tomorrow it can enqueue `describeFailure(...)` onto a queue that an
// agent drains, reproduces, and opens a fix PR against. Nothing here depends on
// that — `withHealing` is pure library code with no AI or network coupling. It
// just turns typed errors into structured, actionable signals and gives you the
// place to route them.
//
// Design notes, in keeping with the rest of Louise:
//   - **Fails toward availability.** A route that has a `fallback` for its
//     error code returns that fallback rather than a 500; only codes with no
//     matching rule re-throw. (Same spirit as security/rate-limit's fail-open.)
//   - **Deterministic + injectable.** `sleep` is injected (default real timer)
//     so tests exercise backoff without wall-clock delay.
//   - **Retries re-run the whole route.** Safe for idempotent reads; unsafe for
//     non-idempotent writes (a retried POST can double-write). `retries`
//     defaults to 0 — opt in only for codes whose route is safe to repeat.

 *
 *   1. Non-`LouiseError`s re-throw immediately — we only heal typed errors.
 *   2. The error's `code` selects a rule (`rules[code]`, else `fallbackRule`).
 *      No matching rule ⇒ re-throw.
 *   3. While attempts remain under the rule's `retries`, back off and re-run.
 *   4. Once retries are exhausted: `escalate` (fire-and-forget via
 *      `waitUntil`), then `fallback` (return its Response) — or re-throw the
 *      last error if the rule has neither.
