// louise-toolkit/worker — a cookie-aware edge cache for the SSR fallback (#163).
//
// Why not just `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control`? That header drives Cloudflare's
// AUTOMATIC edge cache, which is keyed by URL and runs BEFORE the Worker — so it
// is blind to cookies. A page cached for an anonymous visitor is then served to
// a logged-in editor straight from the edge, without the Worker (or Astro's
// `Astro.cache.set(false)`) ever running. There is no way to make that automatic
// cache cookie-aware from inside a Worker.
//
// So this wraps the SSR handler and caches in the Worker-controlled Cache API
// (`caches.default`) instead: the Worker runs on every request, inspects it, and
// only reads/writes the cache for non-bypassed (public) GETs. Bypassed (editor)
// requests always run the handler fresh. Two things keep `caches.default` the
// ONLY cache that ever holds a page (so it can't be served cookie-blind to an
// editor):
//   1. STRIP `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control` from every response, so Cloudflare's
//      automatic (cookie-blind) edge cache never engages.
//   2. Send the client `Cache-Control: no-store` for any page this layer caches,
//      so no browser, CF edge, proxy, or leftover "Cache Everything" Cache Rule
//      shared-caches the HTML — and a browser can't serve its cached PUBLIC copy
//      after the visitor enters edit mode. The cache entry keeps its own TTL.
// Both were the failure mode behind the #163/#165 reverts (a shared cache served
// editors). Editor requests are excluded by construction (the `bypass` predicate).
//
// The route still decides cacheability the same way (`Astro.cache.set(...)` →
// the provider emits `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control`); this wrapper just consumes
// that header as the "cache me" signal rather than letting Cloudflare act on it.
