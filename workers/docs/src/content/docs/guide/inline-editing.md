Inline editing is the heart of Louise: in edit mode, each editable region on the
page becomes editable *in place*, and only the fields that actually change are
saved.

## Field markers

An editable region carries a `data-louise-field` marker whose value is
`"<collection>:<key>:<field>"`:

```html
<h1 data-louise-field="settings:1:heroHeadline">…</h1>
<div
  data-louise-field="settings:1:heroIntro"
  data-louise-type="richtext"
>…</div>
```

- **Plain text** (no `data-louise-type`) becomes a single-line
  `contenteditable="plaintext-only"` region.
- **Rich text** (`data-louise-type="richtext"`) mounts the ProseKit editor — see
  [Rich text](/guide/rich-text/).

List items are patched by index with a dotted field: `aboutParagraphs.2`.

## Mounting the client

```ts
import { mountLouise } from "louisecms/client";

// Safe to call on every page: if there are no markers (the page wasn't rendered
// in edit mode), mountLouise does nothing — so you can lazy-import it.
mountLouise();
```

`mountLouise` finds the markers, attaches the right editor to each, and mounts
the **edit bar** for the page: a live-status dot, the editor's name, and three
actions — **Save**, **Settings** (dispatches a `louise:open-drawer` event), and
**Done** (leaves edit mode).

The client also re-exports the pieces a host app's own panels reuse, so the
drawer renders the same editor and icon set as inline editing:

```ts
import { RichText, mountRichText, Icon } from "louisecms/client";
```

See the [client reference](/reference/client/) for the full export list.

## The save contract

On **Save**, the client sends **one `PATCH` per changed field** to your save
endpoint (e.g. `POST /api/louise/save`). Unchanged fields are never sent.

Your endpoint owns two responsibilities Louise cannot do for you:

1. **Authorize the write** from the session — *not* from the page's edit mode.
2. **Allowlist every writable field.** A forged request must not reach a column
   you didn't list.

```ts
// Sketch of a save endpoint.
const EDITABLE_SETTINGS = new Set(["heroHeadline", "heroIntro", "footerBlurb"]);
const RICH_FIELDS = new Set(["heroIntro"]); // sanitized as HTML

export async function POST({ request, locals, env }) {
  if (!locals.editor) return new Response("Forbidden", { status: 403 });
  const { field, value } = await request.json();
  if (!EDITABLE_SETTINGS.has(field)) return new Response("Unknown field", { status: 400 });
  const clean = RICH_FIELDS.has(field) ? sanitize(value) : String(value);
  // …persist `clean` to your D1 row via db(env.DB)…
  return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
}
```

## Adding an inline-editable field

The pattern, generalised:

1. Add the field to your content type and give it a seed/default value.
2. Render it with the marker (plain or `data-louise-type="richtext"`).
3. Allowlist it in the save endpoint (and in your rich-field set if it's HTML).

That's the whole loop — no schema migration on the CMS side, because the schema
is yours.
