description: The opinionated meta-framework over Louise and Astro — one typed config that generates the worker, middleware, and schema a site would otherwise hand-write.

  order: 14

Louise is the unopinionated toolkit: primitives you assemble yourself. **Astroid**
is the opinionated preset on top — a section library, a theme system, and a single
typed config that generates the Louise wiring a site would otherwise write by hand.

```
Astro        →  renderer / router / build
  Louise     →  unopinionated primitives + framework glue   (louise-toolkit)
    Astroid  →  opinions: theme, sections, config, scaffold  (astroidjs)
```

Dependencies flow one way — `astroidjs` → `louise-toolkit`, never the reverse.

:::caution[Pre-1.0, and moving fast]
Both packages are published (`astroidjs`, `create-astroid`) but pre-1.0. Breaking
changes ship as a **minor** bump, so pin an exact version if you depend on one.

## Which one do I want?

| | Louise | Astroid |
|---|---|---|
| You already have an Astro app | ✅ add it | ❌ scaffolds a new one |
| You want to choose your own schema, routes, auth | ✅ | ❌ it chooses for you |
| You want a running editable site today | assembly required | one command |
| You need a page-builder + section library | build it | ships 15 sections |

If you're adding editing to an app you already have, use [Louise directly](/guide/quickstart/).
If you're starting a brand-new site on Cloudflare, start here.

## Scaffold

```sh
pnpm create astroid my-site
```

Every option is prompted for; in a non-TTY each prompt takes its default, so the
command is CI-safe. The target directory must be empty.

```
pnpm create astroid [directory] [options]

  --name <name>         Brand / site name
  --key <slug>          Project key (slug); names the generated bindings
  --archetype <type>    marketing | storefront | wholesale | portfolio
  --color <hex>         Brand color
  --host <domain>       Primary domain, e.g. example.com
  --commerce <provider> square | stripe | fourthwall
  --map                 Self-hosted PMTiles/MapLibre location map
  --pwa                 Installable PWA (scoped service worker + manifest)
  --portal              Customer/member portal (a second, isolated auth instance)
```

You get a working floor, not a blank page: an inline-editable home page,
magic-link editor sign-in, the editor drawer wired up, migrations, and a
`wrangler.jsonc` with every binding stubbed.

## One config

The whole shape of the project is one typed file. `astroid generate` turns it
into `src/schema.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/middleware.ts`.

```ts
import { defineAstroid } from "astroidjs";

export default defineAstroid({
  key: "coracle",
  archetype: "storefront",
  theme: { name: "Coracle Coffee", colors: { brand: "#1f6f78" } },
  sections: ["hero", "banner", "productGrid", "locationHours", "contact"],
  commerce: { provider: "square" },
  deploy: { platform: "cloudflare" },
});
```

**One brand per project.** Every site Astroid targets serves a single brand from a
single deploy, so the config describes one brand, not an array. What multiplexes
is *editors* (Louise's org plugin) and *audiences* (a gated portal beside the
public site).

### Archetypes

`marketing` (the lean brochure floor), `storefront` (DTC shop), `wholesale`
(B2B/private-label), `portfolio` (gallery + client portal). An archetype is a
preset of defaults — which sections are on, which tables exist — that the site
then tunes, not a fork.

### Sections

The editable home page is an ordered list of section types. Astroid ships 15:
`hero`, `featureGrid`, `cta`, `gallery`, `media`, `splitImage`, `steps`, `banner`,
`faq`, `pricingTiers`, `testimonial`, `aboutIntro`, `productGrid`,
`locationHours`, `contact`.

The vocabulary is **derived from the catalog**, so a section name that has no
component is a compile error rather than a page that silently fails to render.

## The CLI

```sh
pnpm dev        # astroid dev     — regenerate, then astro dev
pnpm build      # astroid build   — regenerate, then astro build
pnpm doctor     # astroid doctor  — validate config, bindings, generated files
pnpm generate   # astroid generate — rewrite the generated trio
wrangler deploy # or: astroid deploy (plan-first provisioning)
```

### Generated vs. scaffold-once

This distinction is the one worth internalising:

- **Generated** — `src/schema.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, `src/middleware.ts`. A pure
  function of your config, rewritten on every `generate`, and they carry a
  do-not-hand-edit banner. `doctor` fails if one has drifted.
- **Scaffold-once** — `wrangler.jsonc`, `src/auth.ts`, `src/queue.ts`,
  `src/portal-auth.ts`, the service worker, the map embed. Written when absent and
  never overwritten, because each exists to be edited. `wrangler.jsonc` is in this
  set specifically so a provisioned binding id is never clobbered.

Switching a module on later is a config edit plus `astroid generate` — it writes
whatever scaffold-once files the new module needs and leaves your existing ones
alone.

## Modules

Opt-in capabilities, each pulling real infrastructure:

- **`commerce`** — a catalog mirror in D1 with a pulled/owned split, a webhook
  receiver, a queue consumer, and a cron safety net. Providers fill **roles**
  (`storefront` / `invoicing`) rather than being "the" provider, because
  `commerce/stripe` has no catalog API and `commerce/fourthwall` has no invoicing.
- **`portal`** — a second, fully isolated Better Auth instance for
  customers/members: its own mount, cookie prefix, and `portal_*` tables, so a
  portal account can't sign into the studio.
- **`map`** — a self-hosted PMTiles basemap served from R2, brand-recoloured. No
  API key, no external tile host.
- **`pwa`** — a scoped service worker that never caches `/api/*` or the editor,
  plus a derived manifest.

## What's on by default

Three things are wired into every scaffold rather than hidden behind a flag,
because each has a client half that already ships in the editor drawer — leaving
them unmounted meant rendering UI for a subsystem that could never have data.

- **The Home dashboard** (`overviewRoute`) — draft counts, unpublished changes,
  last edit. It's the drawer's initial panel, so it's the first screen an owner
  sees.
- **AI assists** (`aiRoute`, `seoFixRoute`, alt-text on upload) — rewrite a
  selection, suggest SEO, describe an image. All editor-gated, and all degrade to
  a hidden button when the `AI` binding is absent, so they cost nothing unused.
- **Site health** (`healthRoute` + a daily cron) — broken links, images missing
  alt text, published pages with SEO gaps. The summary is stored in the existing
  `RL` namespace under its own key, so there's no extra binding to provision.
  Until the first scan runs the panel says "not checked yet".

### Crons

`wrangler.jsonc` gets a `triggers.crons` list, and the generated worker's one
`scheduled` handler dispatches on `controller.cron` — Cloudflare fires a single
handler for every trigger and that string is the only way to tell them apart.

| Cron | What runs |
|---|---|
| `17 4 * * *` | The daily site-health scan. Always. |
| `0 * * * *` | The catalog re-sync safety net. Commerce only; `queues.cron: false` disables it. |

## Dormant until provisioned

Astroid's modules are opt-in at the **config** level but not at the **account**
level: switching commerce on must not require a Square account before `pnpm dev`
will boot.

So every module follows one rule — a module whose secrets are unprovisioned is
**dormant**. It renders, it serves, it says out loud that it is simulated, and it
never calls upstream with a dummy credential. `create-astroid` seeds every secret
with a loud `DUMMY_REPLACE_ME` sentinel, so a fresh clone has a complete, valid
binding set and zero real credentials.

`astroid doctor` reports which modules are dormant and exactly which secrets are
still missing.
